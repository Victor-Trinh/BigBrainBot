A small Discord bot that uses machine learning to classify if headlines are real
or fake. Send a $about to a Discord channel with the bot for info. Send a
$predict <headline> for a prediction with an accuracy of around 70-80%.

Usage: replace the 'placeholder' in big_brain.py with your bot's token and run. Add the bot to your server through the developer portal.
